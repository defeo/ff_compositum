>  We present algorithms to construct and do arithmetic operations in
>  the algebraic closure of the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$. Our
>  approach is inspired by algorithms for constructing irreducible
>  polynomials, which first reduce to prime power degrees, then use
>  composita techniques. We use similar ideas to give efficient
>  algorithms for embeddings and isomorphisms.
