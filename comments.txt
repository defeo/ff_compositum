Comments to the PC
==================

This new version of "Fast arithmetic for the algebraic closure of
finite fields" integrates all the remarks made by the two referees,
plus some minor typographic and stylistic corrections.

One major change is the reorganization of part of Sections 2
and 3. Notation hasn't changed, and the main results are stated
exactly as before. However, we felt that a change in the order in
which these preliminary results are presented was needed to improve
clarity and synthesis.
